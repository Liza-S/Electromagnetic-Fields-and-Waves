# Helical antennas

My research of helical antennas. The plots shows a diagram of the radiation helical antennas. This part of the laboratory work on the course "Electromagnetic Fields and Waves". Were five antennas initially.

The task was to find a one spiral antenna in which the area of one coil is approximately equal to the calculated wavelength at a frequency of 10,000 MHz.

Wavelength(Î») = 3 cm

After finding this antenna, then measure two adjacent antennas, which are on both sides. 

#### And build their directional patterns.
